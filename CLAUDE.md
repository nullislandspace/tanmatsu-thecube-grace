# The Cube - 3D Render Demo for Tanmatsu

## Project Overview

A software 3D renderer demo for the Tanmatsu ESP32-P4 badge. Displays a spinning textured cube on the 800x480 display using dual-core parallelization. The cube rotates on multiple axes while the camera and lighting remain fixed.

## Build Instructions

```bash
make build      # Build the project
make flash      # Flash to device
make monitor    # View debug output via USB
```

## Controls

- **ESC** - Return to launcher
- **Power button** - Return to launcher
- **Space** - Save screenshot to SD card (requires `CAVAC_DEBUG`, see below)

## Architecture

- **Pure C implementation** - No C++ dependencies to minimize binary size
- **Internal SRAM allocation** - Z-buffer and texture in fast internal SRAM (not PSRAM)
- **Software rasterization** - Triangle rasterization with z-buffer and texture mapping
- **Dual-core rendering** - Rasterization split by columns between Core 0 and Core 1
- **Direct framebuffer access** - Renderer writes directly to PAX framebuffer (no intermediate copy)
- **BGR byte order** - Display framebuffer uses BGR888 format (not RGB)
- **270° display rotation** - Display panel is internally rotated; buffer rows map to screen columns
- **Vsync synchronization** - Tearing effect (TE) pin used for smooth animation

## Debug Mode

Screenshot functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment `#define CAVAC_DEBUG` in `main/main.c`. This enables:
- SD card initialization and mounting
- Space key to save screenshots as PPM files to `/sd/cube_screenshot_XXX.ppm`

Note: SD card must be inserted for screenshots to work. Disabling debug mode reduces binary size by ~107KB.

## Renderer Details

The renderer implements:
- 4x4 matrix transformations (lookat, perspective, viewport, rotation)
- Cube rotation on X, Y, Z axes at different speeds (fixed camera/light)
- Span-based rasterization with incremental float attribute interpolation
- Texture mapping with nearest-neighbor sampling
- Z-buffer depth testing (16-bit with z-clamping to prevent overflow)
- Diffuse lighting (modulates texture color)
- Backface culling

Cube is rendered at 480x480 pixels on the left side of the 800x480 display, with a 320-pixel black bar on the right.

### Z-Buffer Implementation

The z-buffer uses 8-bit integers (configurable via `ZBUFFER_8BIT` define) to fit in internal SRAM for faster access. NDC z-values are mapped from [-1, 1] to [0, 254]. The 8-bit precision is sufficient for the cube demo with no visible z-fighting. Buffer is 16-byte aligned.

For more complex scenes requiring higher depth precision, set `ZBUFFER_8BIT 0` to use 16-bit z-buffer (450KB, allocated from PSRAM).

### Dual-Core Parallelization

Rasterization is split by screen columns:
- Core 0 (main task): Columns 0-239
- Core 1 (worker task): Columns 240-479

Synchronization uses FreeRTOS binary semaphores with frame-level sync (one sync per frame, not per triangle) to minimize overhead.

## Performance

Typical frame timing (~30 fps with vsync):
- Render: ~27ms (dual-core rasterization)
- Vsync wait: ~4ms (synchronized to 60Hz display)
- Blit: ~0.7ms (DMA to display)

With vsync disabled, raw render performance is ~35 fps. With vsync enabled (smooth animation), frames are locked to 30 fps (every other 60Hz refresh) since render time exceeds one vsync period.

### Optimization History
- Original single-core with float z-buffer: ~9 fps
- After eliminating intermediate copy: ~12 fps
- After dual-core parallelization: ~16 fps
- After 16-bit z-buffer optimization: ~19 fps
- After incremental integer edge evaluation: ~18 fps
- After incremental attribute interpolation: ~23 fps
- After span-based rasterization: ~25 fps
- After texture copy to internal SRAM: ~27 fps
- After 8-bit z-buffer in internal SRAM: ~35 fps (raw), ~30 fps (vsync)

### Rasterization Optimizations

**Span-Based Rasterization**: Instead of testing every pixel against edge functions, analytically compute where each edge crosses the current scanline. The intersection of all three half-planes gives the exact span [left, right] where pixels are inside the triangle. The inner loop processes this span without any per-pixel edge tests.

**Incremental Attribute Interpolation (Float)**: Z-depth and UV coordinates use precomputed dx/dy gradients per triangle. At each scanline start, initial values are computed, then incremented per pixel. Float is used to avoid fixed-point overflow issues with large screen coordinates.

**Texture Sampling**: UV values are pre-multiplied by texture dimensions. Texture coordinate wrapping uses bit masking (& 63) instead of modulo.

### Build Optimizations

The following ESP-IDF settings are enabled in `sdkconfigs/tanmatsu`:
- `CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_PERF=y` - Compiler optimization for performance (-O2)
- `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE_QIO=y` - Quad I/O flash mode (nearly 2x flash read speed)
- `CONFIG_SPIRAM_SPEED_200M=y` - Fast PSRAM access for z-buffer

### Hardware Acceleration Investigation

**PIE SIMD** (Processor Instruction Extensions):
- PIE provides 128-bit vector registers (q0-q7) for 8x int16 operations
- Instructions: `esp.vld.128.ip` (load), `esp.vst.128.ip` (store), `esp.vadd.s16` (add)
- **Result**: PIE for z-buffer load/store was slower (~24 fps) than scalar code (~25 fps)
- **Reason**: Overhead of copying to/from aligned local buffers exceeds SIMD benefit. The true bottleneck is texture sampling and pixel writes, which can't be vectorized due to per-pixel array indexing.

**PPA** (Pixel Processing Accelerator):
- PPA supports: Scale, Rotate, Mirror (SRM), Alpha Blend, and Fill operations on rectangular image blocks
- **Result**: Not applicable to software triangle rasterization
- **Reason**: PPA operates on rectangular blocks with uniform transforms. Our texture mapping requires per-pixel UV lookups (arbitrary warp), triangles aren't rectangular, and PPA has no depth testing. PPA is designed for scaling camera frames or compositing UI layers, not 3D rendering.

### Vsync Synchronization

The display has a tearing effect (TE) pin that signals vertical blanking. Vsync is enabled via:
```c
bsp_display_set_tearing_effect_mode(BSP_DISPLAY_TE_V_BLANKING);
bsp_display_get_tearing_effect_semaphore(&vsync_sem);
```

Before each blit, the main loop waits on the semaphore to synchronize with the display refresh. This eliminates animation stuttering/jumping that occurred without vsync.

### Simple Bitmap Font

PAX font rendering is too slow for real-time FPS display. A custom 5x7 bitmap font (`simple_font.h`) draws directly to the framebuffer. The font uses screen coordinates (where text should appear as the user sees it) and the coordinate transform to buffer coordinates handles the 270° display rotation automatically - no glyph rotation needed. Supports digits 0-9, decimal point, space, and "fps" letters.

### Hershey Vector Font

For scalable text rendering in the info panel, a Hershey vector font implementation (`hershey_font.h`) draws directly to the framebuffer using Bresenham line drawing. The font data (`hershey.h`) contains the SIMPLEX character set from paulbourke.net/dataformats/hershey/ - 95 ASCII characters (32-126) as coordinate arrays.

**Font format**: `simplex[95][112]` array where each character has:
- `[0]` = number of vertices
- `[1]` = character width
- Subsequent pairs: (x, y) coordinates, (-1, -1) = pen up

**Usage**:
```c
// font_height is the desired height in pixels
hershey_draw_string(fb_pixels, fb_stride, fb_height, x, y, "Text", font_height, r, g, b);
```

**Coordinate system**: Uses screen coordinates (800×480 as user sees it, x=0 left, y=0 top). The 270° display rotation is handled internally by the pixel-setting function.

### Buffer Coordinate Mapping (270° Rotation)

Due to the 270° display rotation, buffer coordinates map to screen coordinates as follows:
- **Buffer rows** (Y axis, 0-799) map to **screen columns** (X axis, left-to-right)
- **Buffer columns** (X axis, 0-479) map to **screen rows** (Y axis)

The cube renders to buffer rows 0-479 (screen left side). The right-side black bar corresponds to buffer rows 480-799. Since buffer rows are contiguous in memory, clearing the black bar is a single `memset` operation:
```c
memset(pixels + 480 * stride, 0, (display_v_res - 480) * stride);
```

This is much faster than `pax_background()` which clears the entire framebuffer. The renderer already clears its own 480x480 region, so only the black bar needs explicit clearing.

### DMA Blit Race Condition

**IMPORTANT**: The `bsp_display_blit()` function uses DMA and is asynchronous - it returns before the transfer completes. Any framebuffer modifications (clearing, text drawing) must happen AFTER waiting for vsync and BEFORE the next blit call. Otherwise, the DMA from the previous blit may still be reading the buffer while new data is being written, causing visual artifacts (flickering, partial overwrites).

Correct frame loop order:
1. Render cube (writes to left 480×480 area)
2. Wait for vsync
3. Clear right bar + draw text (safe - previous DMA complete)
4. Blit to display (starts new DMA transfer)

### Future Optimization Opportunities

- **Smaller render resolution**: Render at 240×240, use PPA to scale up to 480×480
- **Lower color depth**: RGB565 instead of RGB888 (fewer bytes per pixel write)

## Memory Considerations

Memory allocation strategy (all in internal SRAM for maximum performance):
- `zbuffer` (225KB) - uint8_t array for depth testing, allocated from internal SRAM
- `texture_sram` (12KB) - 64x64 RGB texture copied from flash to internal SRAM

At startup, ~533KB internal SRAM is free (largest block ~376KB). Using 8-bit z-buffer (225KB) instead of 16-bit (450KB) allows it to fit in internal SRAM, providing a ~30% performance boost over PSRAM.

The renderer writes directly to the PAX graphics library framebuffer with stride support, eliminating the need for an intermediate render buffer.
